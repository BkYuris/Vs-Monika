Hello. I'm not too sure who I'm speaking to, but...

You're the player, aren't you? You saw me on Friday Night Funkin' Central's YouTube channel and-

Yes, I know a lot more than you think I do.

Like how I know the creators of this Corruption mod! I'm glad I made it out alive after that kid erased the files...

FNF Central did the coding, charting, and remixes for the mod!
BoopaKoopa did the cutscene animation!
Daniboy, JoeyBoi, and RyZe did the new sprites!

And special thanks to Rain, Flippy, Blantados, Gryscl, and Musical Sleep for helping with some things in the mod that wouldn't be possible without them!

That's all for the credits! Now, if you'll excuse me, Senpai and I are headed to an arcade.

I hope I'll see you there!
